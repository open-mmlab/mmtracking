# Benchmark and Model Zoo

## Common settings

- We use distributed training.
- All pytorch-style pretrained backbones on ImageNet are from PyTorch model zoo.
- For fair comparison with other codebases, we report the GPU memory as the maximum value of `torch.cuda.max_memory_allocated()` for all 8 GPUs. Note that this value is usually less than what `nvidia-smi` shows.
- We report the inference time as the total time of network forwarding and post-processing, excluding the data loading time. Results are obtained with the script `tools/analysis/benchmark.py` which computes the average time on 2000 images.
