# Migration from MMTracking 0.xx

Compared with the 0.xx versions of MMTracking, the latest 1.xx version of MMTracking has the following importrant modifications.

## Overall Structures

The `core` in the old versions of MMTracking is splited into `engine`, `evaluation`, `structures`, `visualization` and `model/task_moduls` in the 1.xx version of MMTracking. Details can be seen in the [user guides](docs/en/user_guides)

### keys of learning scheduler

**old**

**new**

```

## Model

### Data preprocessor

The 1.xx versions of MMtracking add [TrackDataPreprocessor](mmtrack/model/data_preprocessors.py). The data out from the data pipeline is transformed by this module and then fed into the model.

### Train

The training forward of models and heads is performed by calling `loss` function in their respective classes. The arguments of `loss` function in models contain a dict of `Tensor` and a list of `TrackDataSample`.

### Test

The test forward of models and heads is performed by calling `predict` function in their respective classes. The arguments of `predict` function in models contain a dict of `Tensor` and a list of `TrackDataSample`.

## Data

### data structure

The 1.xx versions of MMtracking add two new data structure: [TrackDataSample](mmtrack/structures/track_data_sample.py) and [ReIDDataSample](mmtrack/structures/reid_data_sample.py). These data structures wrap the annotations and predictions from one image (sequence) and are used as interfaces between different components.

### dataset class

The 1.xx versions of MMTracking add two base dataset classes which inherient from the `BaseDataset` in MMEngine: `BaseSOTDataset` and `BaseVideoDataset`. The former is only used in SOT and the latter is used for all other tasks.

### data pipeline

1. Most of the transforms on image sequences in the old MMTracking are refactored in the latest MMTracking. Specifically, we use `TransformBroadcaster` to wrap the transforms of single image.

Some transforms on image sequences, such as `SeqCropLikeStark`, are reserved since `TransformBroadcaster` doesn't support setting different arguments respectively for each image in the sequence.

2. We pack the `VideoCollect`, `ConcatSameTypeFrames` and `SeqDefaultFormatBundle` in the old MMTracking into `PackTrackInputs` in the latest MMTracking.

3. The normalizaion in the pipeline in the old MMTracking is removed and this operation is implemented in the model forward.

### data sampler

The 1.xx versions of MMtracking add `DATA_SAMPLERS` registry. You can customize different dataset samplers in the configs. Details about the samplers can be seen [here](mmtrack/datasets/samplers)

## Evaluation

The old versions of MMTarcking implement evaluation in the dataset class. In the 1.xx versions of MMTracking, we add `METRICS` registry. All evaluation are implemented in the metric classes registered in `METRICS`. Details can be seen [here](mmtrack/evaluation/metrics).

## Visualization

The 1.xx versions of MMTracking add `TrackLocalVisualizer` and `DetLocalVisualizer` which are registered in `VISUALIZER`. Compared with the 0.xx versions of MMTracking, we support the visualization of images and feature maps. Details can be seen [here](mmtrack/visualization/local_visualizer.py)

## Engine

The runner, hook, logging and optimizer in the training, evaluation and test are refactored in the 1.xx versions of MMTracking. Details can be seen in MMEngine.
