## Introduction

MMTracking is an open source video perception toolbox based on PyTorch.
It is a part of the OpenMMLab project.

The master branch works with **PyTorch1.3+**.

### Major features

- **The First Unified Video Perception Platform**

  We are the first open source toolbox that unifies versatile video perception tasks include video object detection, single object tracking, and multiple object tracking.

- **Modular Design**

  We decompose the video perception framework into different components and one can easily construct a customized method by combining different modules.

- **Simple, Fast and Strong**

  **Simple**: MMTracking interacts with other OpenMMLab projects. It is built upon [MMDetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection) that we can capitalize any detector only through modifying the configs.

  **Fast**: All operations run on GPUs. The training and inference speeds are faster than or comparable to other implementations.

  **Strong**: We reproduce state-of-the-art models and some of them even outperform the offical implementations.
